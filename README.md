### A curated list of awesome links to resources around Axway's Hyperloop for Titanium

**What is Hyperloop?**

Use any native API via JavaScript
Anything you can write in Objective-C, Swift, Java, or C# can be represented with JavaScript.

**What is this repo for?**

There's so much **awesomeness about Hyperloop**, but it's **difficult to find** an aggregated spot of up-to-date **information about it**.

This repo is an attempt to bridge that gap and link the community to relevant information so that we can **make more badass software**!

**Cool!  What can I do?**

 - [Medium.com](https://medium.com/all-titanium/titanium-an-introduction-to-hyperloop-by-hans-knoechel-47d4326ca52e) - Blog post by Rene Pot - Featuring Hans Knoechel.   At the TitaniumNL meetup in Amsterdam at February 3rd, Hans Knoechel talked about Hyperloop and what Hyperloop actually is.
In short, Hyperloop allows you to talk from Javascript straight to Objective-C/Swift or Java without having to write wrapper modules. This makes it really really easy to extend native APIâ€™s for Titanium.
The presentation has been recorded and can be seen in full on YouTube.

By Erin Bailey
October 25, 2017: 
Intreview with Nazir Dogan, Mobile Application Developer and Software Developer at Etiya, has been using Hyperloop since its early days to create six unique open-sourced modules.

[Enabling Hyperloop](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Enabling+Hyperloop)
> Each Titanium project that want to use Hyperloop requires the Hyperloop-services to be enabled. By default, Hyperloop is disabled and you can enable it for your projects via the CLI or within Studio.
**TL;DR**

- For ```iOS``` add ```<use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework>``` to ```tiapp.xml``` 
- Add ```<module>hyperloop</module>``` to ```tiapp.xml``` 
- Add ```<plugin version="2.2.1">hyperloop</plugin>``` to ```tiapp.xml``` 


[AppC Blog - Tech Tutorial: Hyperloop Modules](http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2017/07/tech-tutorial-hyperloop-modules/)

> In this in-depth video, Developer Evangelist **Jason Kneen** provides an overview of Titanium, its benefits and how it works. The tutorial delves into best practices for UI and views, navigation, buttons and labels, event handling, and data binding. Jason also demonstrates how these concepts are used in practice with a sample project code walkthrough.
